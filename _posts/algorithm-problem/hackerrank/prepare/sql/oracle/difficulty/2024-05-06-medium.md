# Prepare - Medium 난이도 모든 문제(Oracle)

## [The PADS](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-pads/problem?isFullScreen=true){: target="_blank" }

![01-the-pads(1)](/assets/img/posts/algorithm-problem/hackerrank/prepare/sql/oracle/difficulty/medium/01-the-pads(1).jpg)

![03-the-pads(3)](/assets/img/posts/algorithm-problem/hackerrank/prepare/sql/oracle/difficulty/medium/03-the-pads(3).jpg)

```sql
SELECT name || '(' || SUBSTR(occupation, 1,1) || ')'
  FROM occupations
 ORDER BY name ASC;
 
SELECT 'There are a total of ' || TO_CHAR(COUNT(occupation)) || ' ' || LOWER(occupation) || 's.'
  FROM occupations
 GROUP BY occupation
 ORDER BY COUNT(occupation) ASC, LOWER(occupation) ASC;
```

## [Occupations](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/occupations/problem?isFullScreen=true){: target="_blank" }

![04-occupations(1)](/assets/img/posts/algorithm-problem/hackerrank/prepare/sql/oracle/difficulty/medium/04-occupations(1).jpg)
![05-occupations(2)](/assets/img/posts/algorithm-problem/hackerrank/prepare/sql/oracle/difficulty/medium/05-occupations(2).jpg)
![06-occupations(3)](/assets/img/posts/algorithm-problem/hackerrank/prepare/sql/oracle/difficulty/medium/06-occupations(3).jpg)

```sql
SELECT doctor, professor, singer, actor
  FROM (SELECT name,
               occupation,
               RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY occupation ORDER BY name) AS rank
          FROM occupations)
 PIVOT (MAX(name) FOR occupation IN ('Doctor' AS doctor, 'Professor' AS professor, 'Singer' AS singer, 'Actor' AS actor))
 ORDER BY rank ASC;
```

![스크린샷 2024-05-07 164602](/assets/img/posts/algorithm-problem/hackerrank/prepare/sql/oracle/difficulty/medium/스크린샷 2024-05-07 164602.jpg)

`PIVOT()` 함수의 문법은 `PIVOT(Value컬럼명 FOR Unstack컬럼명 IN (값1, 값2, ... 값n)` 이다. 이때 Value 컬럼과 Unstack 컬럼은 `FROM` 절에 명시가 되어있어야 하고, Value 컬럼과 Unstack 컬럼으로 선택되지 않은 `FROM` 절의 모든 컬럼이 Stack 컬럼이 된다.

```sql
SELECT doctor, professor, singer, actor
  FROM occupations
 PIVOT (MAX(name) FOR occupation IN ('Doctor' AS doctor, 'Professor' AS professor, 'Singer' AS singer, 'Actor' AS actor));
```

만약 위와 같이 `FROM` 절에서 서브쿼리(인라인 뷰)를 사용하지 않고 컬럼이 두개(`name`, `occupation`)밖에 존재하지 않는 `occupations` 테이블을 그대로 사용한다면, Value 컬럼과 Unstack 컬럼으로 선택되지 않은 나머지 컬럼이 존재하지 않기 때문에 Stack 컬럼이 없게 된다.

|  doctor  |  professor  |    singer   |     actor     |
|:----------:|:-------------:|:------------:|:-------------:|
|    Priya  |   Priyanka   |  Kristeen  |  Samantha  |

즉, `FROM` 절에서 서브쿼리를 사용하지 않은 위 쿼리의 출력은 위와 같게 된다.

> `PIVOT()` 함수 내부에서 사용한 `MAX()` 함수 대신 다른 집계 함수를 사용해도 상관없다.

## [Binary Tree Nodes](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/binary-search-tree-1?isFullScreen=true){: target="_blank" }

![07-binary-search-tree-1(1)](/assets/img/posts/algorithm-problem/hackerrank/prepare/sql/oracle/difficulty/medium/07-binary-search-tree-1(1).jpg)
![08-binary-search-tree-1(2)](/assets/img/posts/algorithm-problem/hackerrank/prepare/sql/oracle/difficulty/medium/08-binary-search-tree-1(2).jpg)
![09-binary-search-tree-1(3)](/assets/img/posts/algorithm-problem/hackerrank/prepare/sql/oracle/difficulty/medium/09-binary-search-tree-1(3).jpg)

```sql
SELECT n, CASE WHEN p IS NULL THEN 'Root'
               WHEN n IN (SELECT p FROM bst) THEN 'Inner'
               ELSE 'Leaf'
           END AS node_type
  FROM bst
 ORDER BY n ASC;
```

위 쿼리는 스칼라 서브쿼리를 사용한 풀이다. 직관적이기는 하지만 스칼라 서브쿼리는 성능이 좋지 않다.

```sql
 SELECT n, CASE WHEN CONNECT_BY_ISLEAF = 1 THEN 'Leaf'
                WHEN LEVEL = 1 THEN 'Root'
                ELSE 'Inner'
            END AS node_type
   FROM bst
  START WITH p IS NULL
CONNECT BY PRIOR n = p
  ORDER BY n ASC;
```

위 쿼리는 계층형 질의를 사용한 풀이다. `START WITH` 절의 조건을 만족하는 값은 최상위 계층이 되고, `CONNECT BY PRIOR` 절의 조건에 따라 계층이 나뉜다. `CONNECT_BY_ISLEAF`는 계층형 질의 가상 컬럼으로써 최하위 노드가 존재한다면 1을, 존재하지 않는다면 0을 반환한다.
